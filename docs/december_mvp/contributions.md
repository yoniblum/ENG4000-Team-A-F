  ITP metric allowed me to holistic view my team, and view different member perspectives that may not get an opportunity to communicate during the meeting. In essence, I was able to effectively identify my strenghts, and work on my weeknesses.

* Siddharth Bhardwaj: Work in progress, but we’re getting there. Our sprints were a success- this showed improvement in team cohesion. However, there have been challenges with establishing a workflow that works for everyone- due to previous conflicts in the team. We have come far in this project, learning about the AMBU bag, pumping mechanism and improving teamwork skills- through using ITP peer-evaluation for feedback, and we can go further and do much better as a team.
